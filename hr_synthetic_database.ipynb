    "1. **Company Specification**: Convert user input into a structured company specification using LLM.\n",
    "2. **Demographic Ratios**: Generate demographic ratios based on company characteristics using LLM.\n",
    "3. **Database Setup**: Create the database structure with HR schema.\n",
    "4. **Business Unit Processing**: For each business unit:\n",
    "   - Add business unit and director job to database.\n",
    "   - Generate director employee (including education, compensation, and storage).\n",
    "   - Process all departments within the business unit.\n",
    "5. **Department Processing**: For each department:\n",
    "   - Add department and all job roles to database.\n",
    "   - Generate department employees in parallel batches (manager + staff).\n",
    "   - Each employee generation includes education determination, compensation calculation, and database storage.\n"
